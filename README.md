Automating Contract Compliance in Supply Chains using Generative AI & Vector Databases üöÄüìú

Description
In today's globalized world, Fortune 500 firms often deal with thousands of contracts from Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers across multiple countries. Ensuring that these contracts comply with various international regulations and company policies is a daunting task, often requiring the manual review of hundreds of thousands of pages. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, leading to non-compliance issues that can result in hefty penalties, product recalls, and damage to the company's reputation.

To address this challenge, we have developed an Automated Contract Compliance Solution using Generative AI and Vector Databases. This innovative solution can automatically scan supplier contracts, identify non-compliant clauses, and highlight specific regulations and policies that need attention. By doing so, it saves thousands of man-hours, protects the firm‚Äôs reputation, and minimizes financial risks.

Key Features
Generative AI: Automatically scans over 100,000 pages in less than 5 minutes to identify non-compliant contracts.
Vector Databases: Stores contract text as vectors for fast and accurate searches.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances the performance of the AI by retrieving additional context from the vector database.
End-to-End Solution: Fully automated and scalable, ready for production use.
Interactive User Interface: Allows quick identification of non-compliant contracts and the specific regulations they violate.

Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
Python: For scripting and automation.
Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Gemini): For natural language understanding and generation.
LangChain: Framework for building LLM applications.
ChromaDB: For efficient vector storage and retrieval.
Cloud Environment: For scalable storage and processing.

Methodology üìö
Data Ingestion: Contracts are scanned and stored in a cloud file system.
OCR Processing: Contracts are converted from image to text using Tesseract OCR in Python.
Text Splitting: Contracts are split into manageable chunks for processing by LLMs.
Vector Embedding: Text chunks are converted into vectors and stored in ChromaDB.
Context Retrieval: Prompts are used to query ChromaDB and retrieve relevant contract sections.
Regulation Check: LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini) check if specific regulations are present in the retrieved contract sections.
Results Visualization: Output is stored in the cloud and can be accessed via an interactive user interface.

Conclusion üéØ
Our Digital Contract Compliance Solution offers a competitive advantage by automating the compliance process in the supply chain, especially for mid-sized contracts that are often overlooked. The solution's novelty lies in creating a vector database tailored for contracts in the technology industry and using business knowledge-based prompts to improve accuracy. The use of open-source technologies ensures cost-effectiveness, and the solution's scalability allows it to be adapted to different industries.
